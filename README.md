# Tutorial on MRP, Safety Stock, ROP, and How to Build It in R

This tutorial introduces essential inventory management concepts, including Material Requirements Planning (MRP), Safety Stock, and Reorder Point (ROP), along with step-by-step instructions on implementing them in R.

## Material Requirements Planning (MRP):
A planning system to determine what materials are needed, in what quantity, and when.
Inputs: Master Production Schedule (MPS), Bill of Materials (BOM), and Inventory Status.
Outputs: Planned orders for raw materials and components.

## Safety Stock:

## Reorder Point (ROP):

The inventory level at which a new order is placed.

# Practice in R:
Step 1: Install necessary libraries like dplyr and tidyverse.
Step 2: Create data frames for demand, lead time, and inventory records.
Step 3: Calculate safety stock using statistical functions.
Step 4: Build an ROP function to automate reorder point calculation.
Step 5: Integrate MRP logic using BOM and lead time data.
